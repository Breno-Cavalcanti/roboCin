# roboCin
- This repository has been created to save the solution for the third part of the selective process of RoboCin.
- Each folder it's a solution for the problem, except the `noise-filtering`, this folder it's for some thing extra for the SLL project, it's a filter wich I wanted to create because of my resarch.
- warning: I put only a filter for the ball in the standard deviation because it was the best filter with better results and I used only the X values of the robot for validation because the Y of the robot and (x,y) of the ball will have the same logic.
